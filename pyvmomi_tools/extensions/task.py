def wait_for_task(task, *args, **kwargs):
    """A helper method for blocking 'wait' based on the task class.

    This dynamic helper allows you to call .wait() on any task to keep the
    python process from advancing until the task is completed on the vCenter
    or ESX host on which the task is actually running.

    Usage Examples
    ==============

    This method can be used in a number of ways. It is intended to be
    dynamically injected into the vim.Task object and these samples indicate
    that. The method may, however, be used free-standing if you prefer.

    Given an initial call similar to this...

    code::
        rename_task = datastore.Rename('new_name')


    simple use case
    ===============

    code::
        rename_task.wait()

    The main python process will block until the task completes on vSphere.

    use with callbacks
    ==================

    Simple callback use...

    code::
        def output(task, *args):
            print task.info.state

        rename_task.wait(queued=output,
                         running=output,
                         success=output,
                         error=output)

    Only on observed task status transition will the callback fire. That is
    if the task is observed leaving queued and entering running, then the
    callback for 'running' is fired.

    :param task: any subclass of the vim.Task object

def poll_task(task, *args, **kwargs):
    """A helper method for polling state changes on the task class.

    Similar to wait_for_task this helper introduces a sleep_seconds optional
    kwarg and a 'periodic' call back that can be used to check vCenter status
    or interact with vCenter periodically while we wait for a task to complete.
    The prime use-case for this utility is the power_on case described below.

    This dynamic helper allows you to call .wait() on any task to keep the
    python process from advancing until the task is completed on the vCenter
    or ESX host on which the task is actually running.

    NOTE: sleep_seconds of 0 indicates check as fast as possible. This
    mode will generate a great deal of network traffic.

    Usage Examples
    ==============

    This method can be used in a number of ways. It is intended to be
    dynamically injected into the vim.Task object and these samples indicate
    that. The method may, however, be used free-standing if you prefer.

    Given an initial call similar to this...

    code::
        rename_task = datastore.Rename('new_name')



    simple use case
    ===============

    code::
        rename_task.poll()

    The main python process will block until the task completes on vSphere
    the datastore object will be updated automatically with the new name.

    use with sleep_seconds
    ======================
    code::
        rename_task.poll(sleep_seconds=0)

    The default sleep_seconds is 1, meaning the vCenter server is polled at
    most 1 time every 1 second. If you set sleep_seconds to 0, the vCenter
    server will be polled as fast as possible. This has the tendency to create
    a great deal of network traffic.

    code::
        rename_task.poll(sleep_seconds=3)

    The process will wait 3 seconds between polling vCenter for task status.
    The default is to wait 1 second between polling vCenter for task updates.

    use with callbacks
    ==================

    Simple callback use...

    code::
        def output(task, state, *args):
            print state

        rename_task.poll(queued=output,
                         running=output,
                         success=output,
                         error=output)

    Only on observed task status transition will the callback fire. That is
    if the task is observed leaving queued and entering running, then the
    callback for 'running' is fired.

    NOTE: *kwargs

    Callbacks with sleep_seconds
    ============================
    code::
        def output(task):
            print task.info.state

        rename_task.poll(sleep_seconds=3,
                         queued=output,
                         running=output,
                         success=output,
                         error=output)

    The wait method will sleep 3 seconds before re-examining the task status
    again.

    The periodic callback
    =====================
    code::
        def check_for_question(task, virtual_machine):
            if virtual_machine.runtime.question:
                handle_vm_question(virtual_machine)

        power_on_task.poll(virtual_machine, periodic=check_for_question)

    You may have a situation where you need to periodically poll the state of
    another object which might block your task's completion. An example of
    this is the PowerOn_Task operation which can be blocked by a question
    appearing on the VM's runtime. Use a periodic task to poll for such a
    change in state and handle things.
